## Outfit 1: Classic With A Pinch Of Fun

When you are feeling the black and white vibes! This monochromatic look is great for hitting the gym, streets, or trails. The high-neck grey marble printed sports bra and matching windbreaker are from Champion by Target. Target is a fabulous place to purchase athletic wear on a budget. This sports bra is unique with the high neck and the strappy back. The bottoms featured here are from Fabletics, an online athletic wear subscription service. I have had great experience with their products, and would especially recommend their leggings, which are super comfortable and high quality at an affordable price point.

For those days where you are up for a pop of color! These are the __ leggings from Lululemon.  These leggings provide maximum comfort and I honestly would wear them everyday if I could. I particularly love this sky blue color- just looking at these leggings makes me happy! The accompanying top is from Fabletics.  I love the look of a strappy top with a bright colored sports bra underneath.  I am wearing a pink sports bra from Old Navy here.

And for when you are feeling a little frisky- here is a fabulous option! I have paired my __ Nike leggings with a simple __ top from Lululemon.  I find it fun to wear a crazy legging, but I like to even it out with a solid top.  I would highly recommend this top, especially for cardio days, as it is incredibly breathable and sweat wicking, but honestly I would wear it for all activities from hiking to biking to yoga to running errands.
